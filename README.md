# Docker Dashboard

An browser interface to interact with Docker on your machine.

Heavily inspired by the great tutorial "[Create a Docker dashboard with TypeScript, React and Socket.io](https://auth0.com/blog/docker-dashboard-with-react-typescript-socketio/)", published by [Steve Hobbs](http://twitter.com/elkdanger).
